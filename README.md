Issues
======

This repository is designed for customers to report server bugs pertaining to the Project Kyra cheat. We encourage collaboration in order to determine the cause of an issue. Please follow the guidelines below.

### Important:

If you find an exploit or other bug that could cause major issues, please consider the following:

1. Privately [contact Project Kyra Administrators](mailto:support@kyra.net) about the issue.
2. **Do not** disclose the issue to the public without allowing time for our staff to fix the issue.

### Do:

* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not already reported.
* Be clear in your description.
* Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/): it can make your issue that much more important, because you put a little more into it.
* Tell steps how to reproduce the issue.

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged).
* Go off topic from an issue.
* Re-create an issue if it was closed.
* Make 'lists' of issues regarding the cheat, instead make a separate issue for each problem.
* Attempt to attack the issues page with malicious intent such as trolling or being rude.
* Add comments such as :+1:, +1, "still broken" or "i like this idea"
* Submit ideas here.
